The ship's clock. It tracks the time of day, the day count, and the sun's position: everything a script needs for day-night timing and solar tracking.

**Access:** `get_component("clock")` · Like every component, exposes `.id` (stable id) and `.name` (display name).

## Methods

### .get_time()
Current time as a 3-element list `[hours, minutes, seconds]` in 24-hour format. Index with `t[0]`, `t[1]`, `t[2]`. Use for time-of-day branches or to wait for specific hours.

**Returns:** List `[hours, minutes, seconds]`

### .get_day()
Current day number: starts at 1 and increments when the in-world clock rolls past midnight. Use for daily-budget logic (e.g. reset counters at the start of each day) or to detect day transitions for machines like the [[Heat Generator]] whose state changes per day.

**Returns:** Number (day count)

### .get_time_of_day()
Current daylight phase as a string: `"dawn"`, `"day"`, `"dusk"`, or `"night"`. This is the simulation phase used by solar/day-night logic; the header may further label `"day"` as Morning/Afternoon/Evening for flavor.

**Returns:** String: dawn / day / dusk / night

### .get_elevation()
Sun's elevation above the horizon (0-90 degrees). 0 at night, rises to 90 at solar noon (equator), back to 0 at dusk. Solar panels peak when their tilt complements the current elevation.

**Returns:** Number (0-90 degrees)

### .tick()
Deterministic simulation tick since save start. At normal speed the simulation grants a fresh script step budget every tick (10 ticks/sec, so one tick is 0.1 simulation seconds). Use tick deltas for profiling script timing instead of wall-clock milliseconds.

**Returns:** Integer simulation tick since save start

### .elapsed_seconds()
Elapsed simulation seconds since save start. This is the same time base that `sleep(seconds)` waits against, not browser wall-clock time.

**Returns:** Number (elapsed simulation seconds)

### .elapsed_game_hours()
Elapsed world-clock hours since save start. Useful for rate calculations and logs that should follow the compressed day/night cycle instead of real seconds.

**Returns:** Number (elapsed world-clock hours)

### .real_seconds_per_hour()
Number of real seconds in one world-clock hour. The day cycle compresses 24 world-clock hours into a fixed real-time window, so `sleep(clock.real_seconds_per_hour())` waits exactly one world-clock hour and multiplying by 24 waits a full day. Lets scripts express world-time delays without hardcoding the conversion.

**Returns:** Number (real seconds per world-clock hour)

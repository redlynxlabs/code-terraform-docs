title: "Vehicle Proximity & Service"

Ground vehicles use a forgiving service-area model. You do not need to land on one exact coordinate, but physical work requires the vehicle to be parked.

## The five terms

- **Near**: the vehicle is inside a machine or outpost service area. It may still be driving through.
- **Stopped**: live speed is zero. A dead battery can stop a vehicle without canceling its route.
- **Parked**: the vehicle has no live movement or positive throttle. `self.nav.brake()` parks it immediately.
- **Docked**: the vehicle is parked inside the service area required by an outpost, machine, or station.
- **Connected**: an item endpoint, pipe, or power relationship has been configured. A connection does not prove that a vehicle is docked and does not move cargo by itself.

The short rule is: **get near, park, then perform physical work**.

## Service areas

Machine and outpost service areas include a **~2 m margin**, so continuous vehicle movement does not need exact floating-point coordinates. An outpost's full footprint is its common service area. A field machine uses its own position and service area. Being near an outpost never makes a field machine part of that outpost.

## Parking before service

```python
x = 25
y = -10
self.nav.set_target(x, y)
self.nav.set_throttle(0.5)
while self.nav.get_distance_to(x, y) > 2:
  sleep(1)
self.nav.brake()
```

After `brake()`, cargo transfer, charging, and hardware service can use the matching service area. A timed cargo handoff keeps the vehicle parked until its handling cycle ends; movement commands return busy during that cycle.

`fleet.vehicles()` reports current activity separately from docking. `.status` can be `"moving"`, `"charging"`, `"drilling"`, or another activity. `.is_docked` means the ground vehicle was parked at an outpost when that snapshot was created; `.docked_at` gives that outpost id.

Drones use explicit station docking. A drone at a field [[Mining Drill]] must have completed its route before it can load ore.

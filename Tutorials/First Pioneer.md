# First Pioneer

A [[Pioneer]] is the first vehicle that turns remote plans into built infrastructure. The usual flow is: buy a Pioneer, mount the modules it needs, send it to the site, and let its local script do the work.

## What makes it different

A [[Rover]] explores and mines. A Pioneer builds. The chassis is only the carrier; mounted modules decide what it can actually do.

For early expansion, look for four module families:

- [[Nav Module]]: moves the Pioneer across the full planet coordinate plane.
- [[Battery Holder]]: carries [[Portable Battery|Portable Batteries]]. At least one charged Portable Battery must be installed or the Pioneer cannot move.
- [[Cargo Rack]]: hosts [[Portable Storage Bin|Portable Storage Bins]] that carry kits, pipe segments, power-line segments, and other build materials.
- [[Constructor Module]]: executes Planet Map blueprints once the right materials are on board.

## Good first goal

Before trying to found an outpost, practice with a small job: put a simple blueprint near home, install a charged Portable Battery, load the required kit or segments into Pioneer cargo, move it to the blueprint, brake, and execute it. The blueprint can come from Plan Mode or `get_component("construction_blueprint")`; either path creates the same persistent job. If the Pioneer cannot leave, check its Battery Holders and installed batteries. If construction is rejected, check the Constructor Module and cargo.

## Where to look

The Info tab explains the module APIs available through `self`. Plan Mode shows material requirements before placement. Query `get_component("construction_blueprint").pending_constructions()` for the queued [[Construction]] snapshots; every one exposes `required_item` and `required_count` to scripts.
